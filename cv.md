## Summary
I intend to work in IT industry. It should be admitted that programming is one of the most interesting, important and significant jobs, that is why it would be really great if I manage to achieve my goal. As I am still a secondary school student, I do not have a lot of experience, but I am hard-working and diligent, so I do not see any problems here.

## Skills
Unfortunately, due to my age, I do not know so much, but I can use:
* Pascal
* HTML & CSS

## English
I have been attending a language school named "Lingvocenter" for 2 years. My current English level is B2 (Upper-Intermediate). Also, I passed PET exam in 2019 and I am going to take FCE exam next year.
